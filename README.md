# Abbott
A bot specifically for the Adam Learns show (Twitch, Discord, etc.).

## Expectations

This code is publicly viewable, but it isn't exactly "open-source":

- The code is not licensed for use by anyone other than myself.
- I don't plan on making the bot be generally available or usable (e.g. I probably won't add features that people ask about).
- I probably won't do anything explicit to maintain this repo unless it's something I need for myself.
